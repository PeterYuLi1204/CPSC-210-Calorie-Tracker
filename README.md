# Calorie and Nutrient Tracker

Going through dailyLog-to-dailyLog life it can sometimes be hard to keep track of what you're putting into your body.
As somebody who has constantly struggled to gain weight, I wanted to build an app that could help people meet their
nutritional goals. Having a way to quickly track what you're eating will be helpful for anyone trying to lose or gain
weight or just eat healthier in general!

## Functionality

The **Calorie and Nutrient Tracker** will allow you to create a log of all the foods you ate in a dailyLog and how many
calories, grams of protein, grams of fat, and grams of sugar it provided.

With this app you'll be able to set **goals** and get **statistics** about whether you're meeting them such as:
- Total calories consumed for a particular day
- Average grams of protein consumed per day
- Total grams of sugar consumed for a particular day
- Food you ate that contains the most fat
- ***Much more***

Those are just some examples with more to come!

Users can then use these statistics to limit how much sugar they eat or hit a particular calorie total with the app 
being able to tell them if they've met goals that they set.
